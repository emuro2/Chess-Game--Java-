=================

MVC Model Chess Game


MVC stands for Model View Controller which is a pattern used for implementing a user interface.

This is a 2-Player Chess Game with two different pieces:

  1. Berolina (link for description: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berolina_chess )
  2. Wazir (link for description: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wazir_(chess) )
  
I implemented:

Menu

•	Board – Have a drop menu for New game, Restart, Pause, and Quit.

          New game is agreeing to start another game.
          Restart is agreeing to end in a tie.
          Pause the game.
          Quit is the same as forfeit.

•	Edit – Undo .

          Undo will undo the last moved made, even if a piece was eaten.

Score Board

          Enter Names of players and it will keep track of your score.

Highlight

          Highlights square selected.
